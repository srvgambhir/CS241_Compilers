    /* Further notes about the toNumber function:
     *
     * This function returns a 64-bit integer instead of 32-bit because
     * .word accepts both signed and unsigned 32-bit integers. The union 
     * of the signed and unsigned ranges cannot be represented by a single 
     * 32-bit type. Even when not working with .word, you should store the
     * result of this function in an int64_t variable, or you might get
     * unexpected behaviour due to C++'s automatic type conversions.
     *
     * If the number represented by the token does not fit in the signed 
     * 64-bit range, there are two possibilities:
     * - If the token is a positive decimal integer or a hexadecimal 
     *   integer, then 2^{63}-1 (the maximum int64_t value) is returned.
     * - If the token is a negative decimal integer, then -2^{63} (the
     *   minimum int64_t value) is returned.
     *
     * Hexadecimal integers are always interpreted as unsigned. For 
     * example, the integer 0xffffffffffffffff (the 64-bit two's 
     * complement representation of -1) will actually be interpreted as 
     * 2^{64}-1, which is out of the signed 64-bit range. Thus, by the above 
     * rule, the value 2^{63}-1 is returned. This behaviour may seem unusual,
     * but is actually important for detecting out of range hex integers.
     * For example, consider: beq $0, $0, 0xffffffffffffffff
     * If the hex integer here was interpreted as -1, that would be bad!
